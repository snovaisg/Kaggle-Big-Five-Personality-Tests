# Kaggle Big Five Personality Tests

# Summary

The Big Five also known as OCEAN model is a grouping for personality traits. This is the most accepted model of personality in academic psychology. The origin of the model comes from the statistical study of responses to personality questions. In particular, using a technique called *factor analysis* researchers can find a way to best summarize individuals despite the possibly unlimited number of personality variables that exist. 5 traits seem to frequently stand out and they are: **extraversion**, **neuroticism**, **agreeableness**, **conscientiousness** and **openness to experience**. The Big-Five aren't the result of a particular test. In fact, a variety of methods have been developed to measure each one of them. This particular test uses the Big-Five Factor Markers from the International Personality Item Pool, developed by [Goldberg (1992)](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F1040-3590.4.1.26).
