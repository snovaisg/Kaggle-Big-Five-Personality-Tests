As said before, this time we will use several clustering techniques such as: Mean-shift clustering, DBSCAN, GMM and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering.

We will start by explaining each of the clustering techniques briefly as well as noting their theoretical implications, so that we are able to fully interpret their results.

Then we will do the same for the T-sne dimensionality reduction techniques so that we can understand it and use it for visualization of the clustering.

After that we will apply each technique at a time, while comparing the visualization of the respective clusters using pca and t-sne.

At the end we will write the report on our findings.




# How to study the clustering techniques
This will guide each team member to know what they should include or not in the theoretical notes of each technique (we created this guide so that we produce no waste of work by going to thoroughly with the study and report).
